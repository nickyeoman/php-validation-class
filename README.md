# php-validation-class

Nix ancient php Validation Class.

I wrote this back in 2009 when I was using CodeIgniter.
I recently had another project where it came in handy.

$validate = new Validate;
$validate->isEmail($email);
$validate->isPhone($phone);
$validate->isPostalCode($postal);
$validate->isZipCode($zip);
